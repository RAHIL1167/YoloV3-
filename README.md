Object Detection using a pretrained model YoloV3
In this we have tried to detect the objects using a pretrained Model which is known as YOLO- You only look once.
This model has already trained with number of objects and is claimed to be fastest in generating the results.
The weights required for this model can be downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

I have performed on a video file which I have randomly downloaded you can find the same in my repo
